  - `CONFLUENCE_SPACE_KEYS`: Additional Confluence space keys to search (comma-separated)
    - Your personal space is always included automatically
    - The R&D space (RD) is always included automatically
    - Space keys can be found in the URL of each space:
      - For global/team spaces: `https://your-instance.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SPACEKEY/overview` â†’ use "SPACEKEY"
      - For personal spaces: automatically handled using your email

- **Assessment Configuration**
  - `TARGET_YEAR`: The year for which you're writing the self-assessment

### How to Get API Keys

1. **Atlassian API Token** (works for both Jira and Confluence):
   - Go to https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
   - Click "Create API token"
   - Give it a name and copy the token
   - This token can be used for both `JIRA_API_TOKEN` and `CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN`

2. **OpenAI API Key**:
   - Visit https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy the key (it will only be shown once)

## Usage

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

2. Run the assistant:
   ```bash
   python self_assessment_assistant/main.py
   ```

The program will:
1. Search through your Jira tickets for the specified year
2. Search through your Confluence content for the specified year
3. Analyze both sources to identify achievements, patterns, and contributions
4. Generate thoughtful responses for each self-assessment question
5. Output the results to the console
6. Save detailed logs to the `logs` directory

## Output

- The generated self-assessment answers will be printed to the console
- Detailed execution logs will be saved in the `logs` directory with timestamps
- Each run creates a new log file for review

## Notes

- The assistant focuses on concrete, verifiable information from both Jira and Confluence
- It maintains authenticity by sticking to actual work completed and documented
- The generated responses aim to present achievements positively while remaining grounded in evidence
- Knowledge sharing and technical expertise are evaluated through Confluence content
